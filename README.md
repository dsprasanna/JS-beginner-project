# N-Queens Puzzle

## Description

The N-Queens puzzle is a classic problem in which the goal is to place `N` chess queens on an `NÃ—N` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a solution to the N-Queens puzzle using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can input the size of the board (N), and the application will visualize the solution(s) on the chessboard.

## Features

- Dynamic board size: Users can specify the value of N.
- Visual representation: The solution(s) are displayed on the chessboard.
- Interactive UI: Users can visualize the placement of queens on the board.
